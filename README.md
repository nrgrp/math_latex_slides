# Mathematical Writing and Typesetting in LaTeX

This repository contains a [note](./article) and the corresponding [slides](./slides) for a brief guideline about mathematical writing and typesetting in LaTeX.

The latest auto-compiled PDF files can be found under the [draft](https://github.com/nrgrp/math_latex_slides/tree/draft) branch.

The note is copied from [this repository](https://github.com/haozhu10015/latex-template) (which is also written by me) on July 8, 2025.
There might be some updates on the material in that repository afterwards, which has a large probability that they do not appear here.
