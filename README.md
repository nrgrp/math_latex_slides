# Mathematical Writing and Typesetting in LaTeX

This repository contains a [note](./article) and the corresponding [slides](./slides) for a brief guideline about mathematical writing and typesetting in LaTeX.

The note is copied from [this repository](https://github.com/haozhu10015/latex-template) (which is also written by me), where there might be some updates on the material from time to time.

The latest auto-compiled PDF files can be found under the [draft](https://github.com/nrgrp/math_latex_slides/tree/draft) branch.
