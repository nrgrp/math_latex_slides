# Mathematical Writing and Typesetting in LaTeX

This repository contains a [note](./article) and the corresponding [slides](./slides) for a brief guideline about mathematical writing and typesetting in LaTeX.

The latest auto-compiled PDF files can be found under the [draft](https://github.com/nrgrp/math_latex_slides/tree/draft) branch.

The note is copied from [this repository](https://github.com/haozhu10015/latex-template) (which is also written by me) on July 8, 2025.
There might be some updates on the material in that repository afterwards, but it is likely that they do not appear here.

More useful templates for articles, slides, posters, etc., can be found in [this repository](https://github.com/nrgrp/nrtemplates).
